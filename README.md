## Experience

#### Marin Software

*Senior Engineer - Portland, Oregon - 2012*

Marin Software allows advertisers to manage online marketing campaigns across a variety of publishers, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Bing.

* Lead development of search features and performance improvements. Developed search and analytic web services. Developed browser library for asynchronously loading search and analytics data, allowing progressive load of page elements.

#### ClearAccess Inc.

*Senior Engineer - Vancouver, Washington - 2009-2012*

ClearAccess develops Auto-Configuration Server (ACS) software and customer-presence equipment (CPE) firmware delivering flexible and scalable device and application management based on the Broadband Forum's TR-069 standard. ClearAccess was acquired by Cisco Systems in March 2012.

* Responsible for development of the ACS product, including: 1. web services and background processes implemented in Scala and Java, 2. user interfaces utilizing AJAX libraries and patterns, 3. data storage (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database, Mongo, Solr) and ORM (Hibernate), and 4. device communication scripting using server-side JavaScript interpreter.

* Developed search and reporting stack, including: 1. object-to-document mapping library converts relational business entities to search documents, 2. background process services requests to index business entities and other index maintenance tasks, 3. domain-specific language parser for representing complex search queries, and 4. reusable UI components for integrating search and reporting features throughout the product.

* Responsible for operational support of production failures. Role includes troubleshooting production environments, instrumenting monitoring and diagnostic endpoints, and fixing coding errors. Work needs to be completed quickly and under pressure from stakeholders.

* Managed product releases, including work prioritization and assignment. Communicated with stakeholders and produced technical requirements, with focus on customer satisfaction and cohesive software architecture. Developed and executed release process to produce deliverables including build artifacts and documentation.

#### Qualcomm, Inc.

*Senior Engineer - Portland, Oregon - 2001-2009*

Qualcomm designs, manufactures, and markets wireless telecommunications products and services based on its CDMA technology, and delivers integrated wireless applications and services to businesses around the world.

* Advanced adoption of hosted web services using J2EE, AJAX, and related technologies. Leader in technology and best practice adoption. Advanced the use of unit testing through advocacy, presentations, mentoring, and championing related techniques such as dependency injection and mock objects. These practices enhance software quality and increase component reusability across projects.

* Object oriented design skills focused on creating testable and reusable code. Created an engine for processing long-haul driver logs according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Hours-of-Service regulations. Implemented the engine in C for maximum source compatibility across platforms. Implemented Java and .NET layers to enable reuse by various projects. Designed and implemented a service for generating PDF and HTML reports. Designed and implemented a service for delivery of email and SMS alert messages based on application-defined logic. Designed and implemented a Google Maps control for geofence manipulation and back-end logic for detecting geofence events. These components enable cross-project reuse, saving development cost and increasing product quality, consistency, and user experience.

* Commitment to innovation and exploration. Developed technology and product demonstrations. Prototyped wireless-enabled consumer electronic devices with web services and UI. Developed proof-of-concept musical ring-tone generation software based on genetic algorithms.

Project highlights:

* FreightWatch is a J2EE web application for real-time monitoring of valuable freight shipments. Features include mapping, geofencing, and alert notification via email and SMS. The application is integrated to Qualcomm and customer back-end systems using REST and JMS interfaces. The application utilizes web application technologies such as AJAX and Google Maps to provide a rich user experience. Implemented the complete application, including the user interface, database, geofencing, alert delivery, and system integration layers. Worked iteratively, with frequent customer interaction and dynamic requirements.

* CER is a "black box" recorder for long-haul trucks. Data is transmitted by satellite to Qualcomm servers and provided to customers via web and SOAP interfaces. CER is implemented using J2EE and related technologies. Provided requirements analysis, design, implementation, test, and deployment.

* AA&D integrates customer data with vehicle position streams to detect business events. Implemented the user interface, customer integration interface, and business-logic state machine.
	
* Designed and built a Java application container for the IBM iSeries platform. The container provides services such as database and thread pooling, task scheduling, durable event delivery, inter-process communication with a J2EE tier, and domain-specific services such as customer data modeling and persistence.
