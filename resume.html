    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h4>MobileRQ</h4>
    <em>Software Architect - Portland, Oregon - 2015-2017</em>
    <blockquote>MobileRQ (<a href="http://www.mobilerq.com">www.mobilerq.com</a>) is a platform that enables targeted content delivery and push notifications for mobile and web applications. MobileRQ was acquired by Kochava (kochava.com) in 2017.</blockquote>
    <p>I developed, operated, and supported MobileRQ's software products, including web applications and services on AWS, and SDKs for iOS and Android. My responsibilities included all aspects of the software stack, including front-end (jQuery, Bootstrap), web tier (Spring MVC/Jersey), data stores (RDS/DynamoDB/S3), and ETL (SQL/Spark). I worked with Scala, Java, and Amazon Web Services daily. I implemented major features and improvements including:</p>
    <p>1. A distributed matching engine built on Apache Ignite (ignite.apache.org) that evaluates customer-defined predicates with customer data. Customer data features are defined using composed hierarchies of monadic transformations. Customer predicates are evaluated in real-time using distributed data flow and compute architecture. This implementation allows MobileRQ to meet a diversity of customer businesses and use-cases.</p>
    <p>2. Architectural refractors, resulting in order-of-magnitude cost saving and reliability improvement.</p>
    <h4>Janrain</h4>
    <em>Software Architect - Portland, Oregon - 2013-2015</em>
    <blockquote>Janrain (<a href="http://www.janrain.com">www.janrain.com</a>) provides social identity and user profile management services for web sites and mobile applications.</blockquote>
    <p>Janrain products are implemented as services configured for individual customer requirements. At Janrain, I led the effort to unify configuration data in a single system of record. My contributions included design and implementation of services for managing configuration data, featuring a DSL for modeling and transforming data over a graph database with compile-time correctness guarantees.</p>
    <p>Janrain services produce profile and event data from sources including social networks, web forms, and user behavior. At Janrain, I led the effort to build analytics products that leverage this data. My responsibilities included project architecture, vendor evaluations, and project planning and leadership.</p>
    <p>Janrain manages engineering projects using the methodologies of scrum, continuous delivery, and iterative development. At Janrain, I defined, prioritized, and sequenced work. I collaborated with individual contributors, and drove stakeholder understanding and alignment. I facilitated process meetings, including sprint planning, sprint retrospective, and demonstrations of progress.</p>
    <h4>Marin Software</h4>
