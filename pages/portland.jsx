        <p>My home is in Portland. I have lived and worked here my entire life.</p>

            Sometimes I think it would be good for me to move away, but I know of nowhere else I'd rather be. There's
            also something to be said for seeing a place grow and change overtime. Portland certainly has, and continues
            to, change.
